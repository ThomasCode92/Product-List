# Product List

Manage a list of your favorite products with the _Product List_ App! Add and Remove as you desire!

**About this Repository**<br />
_'Product List'_ is a [React.js](https://react.dev/) app and was bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/) (via npm)!<br />
This project is part of the _[React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)_ course from [Academind](https://academind.com) and is all about replacing [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) with the [Context API](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) & [Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react).

**View the application**<br />
Run the development server with `npm run start`<br />
This should open your default browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
